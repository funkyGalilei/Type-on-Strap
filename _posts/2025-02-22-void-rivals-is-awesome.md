<p>Wow. There’s a reason why Robert Kirkman is one of the GOATs of comic writing or writing. And it’s showing. Invincible is one of my favorite comics of all time, and Void Rivals might be in the running for that title as well. I’ll be honest, I’m not a massive fan of Transformers or GI Joe (some of the toys and branding/marketing was before my time, but I watched all the live action movies, and the recent Transformers One), but this story is just good.</p>

<p>For those who haven’t heard of Void Rivals, it’s a story featuring 2 star crossed somethings who are from rivaling factions on the same superstructure ring which surrounds a black hole (come on, that sounds dope, you have to admit), and need to work together to uncover the layers on why their societies are pitted against each other. While this is happening, there are mysteries about how the Transformers world fits into theirs, and larger galactic implications happening at the same time. Which I loved. I know almost next to nothing about Transformers lore. Which, in this case (because of good writing) <strong>Doesn’t matter!</strong> So great! The story is unfolding and I don’t know where it’s going. Are the Quintessons going to annihilate a certain sentient robot? No idea. So there’s some suspense I don’t know about.</p>

<p>Of course, Void Rivals is releasing alongside the new Skybound Image series Transformers, so reading that will help give me context but, reading Void Rivals by itself was more than enough. And then of course, how could I not mention <strong>Lorenzo De Felici</strong>. He’s gotta be one of my favorite artists up there with Ryan Ottley. His linework is awesome, and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of different textures per say. So much is communicated with simple lines and a rake brush. Anyway, that’s been it for my praise of Void Rivals. I did a fanart redraw of one of the panels, and hope to do more of this series, just because of its clear visuals! :)</p>
