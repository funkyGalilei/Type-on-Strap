<p>I love blender nodes, and the concept of nodes in general. Visual programming is how we teach students who are first learning the concept, and there’s a reason why we do it like that. Why should we stop? I’m probably a visual learner. After a point, concepts in programming can be visualized in one dimension, just up and down. “For loops” become up and down back and forth motions instead of actual loops. The simulation nodes in Blender however? It's a region. And makes me think about how the process is actually looping because the logic is placed in a 2D space. </p>

<p>Random plug, I still think randomly about Michael Reeves doing whatever he did in Scratch as a testament to how powerful something supposedly “simple” could be: <a href="https://youtu.be/bZDE6I5B9-E?si=Gg59VdaTMZ_EcDr3">https://youtu.be/bZDE6I5B9-E?si=Gg59VdaTMZ_EcDr3</a></p>

<p>But anyway, geometry nodes in Blender were my first reintroduction to a node based workflow since Scratch, and it was a welcome one. I followed a few tutorials, well numerous tutorials online and had a lot of fun learning. But actually having something in your head that doesn’t exist somewhere online and then actually being able to realize it out of nothing?? That’s the magic stuff that makes it fun to program. I have 2 examples I’m going to write about here. </p>

The nodes surrounded by the pale purple are the ones that get called upon every dt, or simulation time. Fun fact, values that are passed into the start and end block can be Baked, like any other parameter in Blender’s physics!</figcaption></figure>

You can’t read all of them from here, but it ends up being simpler than you would think. This was before I had the addon Node Wrangler as well, so it would’ve looked cleaner</figcaption></figure>

<p>The first one I will talk about is the exhaust plume from this cartoonish Rocketship. I was planning on making a video on this process, because it was the first thing I created that I don’t think existed on the internet. There are tutorials on how to map an audio file’s frequency intensity to a location, but there definitely is no tutorial on how to take that signal and map it to the particle size of an exhaust - having each particle be the mapped size statically and get bigger as it travels farther down the plume. Now, I’ll admit, I cheated on that last one (I just used a lattice deforming the geometry node mesh after it was computed). But the simulation part of the node groups I am really proud of. One of the weird quirks with Blender that I haven’t quite figured out is Instances, and when to use the Realize Instance node. Deleting the particles after a set time (by tracking their lifetime with a simple iterated variable - i++) could only happen when they were Instances. So there’s still some improvement to go. Creating a self deleting particle that also gets bigger within the simulation node group would be great. In the future, I’ll do it.</p>

<p>For my next example, I created these morphing backgrounds that are all node-based in Blender’s Shader Editor. There are premade textures that are procedurally generated with algorithms such as a Voronoi texture, which was used to make the one on the right mixed with a hue shifting over time setup. The one on the left was made with a simple noise texture, hooked up to both the value output and the hue output, creating a random spotty clown sort of vibe. In addition, the noise can have a “W” input, if it is generated up to the 4th dimension, which gives it a fourth parameter that you can use to animate the shader. Pretty easy to create some really trippy backgrounds easily with some shifting values and the premade algorithms Blender has built in. </p>

<p>I look forward to pushing this node based system even farther and discovering new techniques! :D</p>
