<p>Opening Blender for the first time gave me weird Deja Vu. Obviously the 3D viewport is normal to many 3D modelling softwares, but the familiar feeling would continue for a bunch of different fun aspects of the program. Funnily enough, the drawing part of the program (grease pencil), I haven’t tried out fully yet - that would be the obvious 1 to 1 comparison.<br></p>

<p>But yes, I haven't touched Blender before and it meshed well with numerous things I learned in my undergraduate, and made those comparisons visual. One of my favourite things about simulations is representing them physically. When using MATLAB, it wasn’t enough to just solve the ODE and move on. Simulating it visually is what brought everything together and made it presentable. In Blender, all the math and fun procedural stuff is done using things called “geometry nodes”. It’s similar to a visual code system, like Scratch. There’s geometry nodes like Euler Rotation, and Vector Math, which can rotate or change curves or paths. I love features like these, and blender is the first program I’ve used that takes complicated math and meshes and attaches a nice snapping node system to it. It's like coding but doesn’t feel like it. Maybe it’s just me, but in order to feel like I’m coding I need to run into 3 errors and try to debug for 2 hours. The color coded node system is great, and the data types are familiar as well.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>There is also a part of me that feels like I’m cheating. Surely I can’t just delete a face or not have the dimensions be driven, but nope, this is just art software. There are some functions present in Solidworks that I wished were in Blender, like shell or revolve (You actually can revolve around a point but it takes an extra step). The UV mapping or unwrapping feels the most equivalent to creating a 2D drawing, but even then you can just texture the object directly in the viewport, so you can get away with a lot. </p>

<p>I really wish that I learned Blender earlier, as the concepts would have been better presented visually. Things like noise, and vector rotations are updated in real time. A side by side with a matrix would be a great learning tool<br></p>

<p>So far I have made a little sapling that I’ll show off soon, that has an animation attached. It’s really nice to not have to iterate a variable and draw it to a frame, but instead just have a driver attached to that variable and go directly to output. I’m hoping to do a lot more cool things with Blender, both on the scripting side (Python can be attached), and on the more creative side (sculpting and getting better at modelling). Looking forward to doing more with it! :)</p>
