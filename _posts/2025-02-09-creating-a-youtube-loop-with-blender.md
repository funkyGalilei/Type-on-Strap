<p>I got the initial idea for this concept from a close friend. She gave me this surreal prompt, involving 2 rubber duckies floating in space. I knew how to model at this point, and had the feeling I always love to have: ‚ÄúI can actually execute this idea!‚Äù</p>

<p>I decided 2 rubber ducks floating and angling around in place (which wouldn't actually happen in space but ya know) would be great, and looked up a tutorial on how to make a star field background effect. I fortunately did not need to look up how to animate, as I had seen a couple clips that clued me in to how to insert key frames and to use the dope sheet, so I used minimum tutorials for this.</p>

<p>One of the only downsides of the process of learning Blender it is the documentation. Actually referencing the documentation is good in understanding what each parameter or option does, but isn't good when you have the thought ‚Äúhow do I create [blank] effect. Of course, listing all the random effects that involve option checking and a sequence of connected geometry nodes doesn't really work in a PDF or web format so I get it. I just get annoyed having to speed through YouTube tutorials when a screenshot of the geonodes would be better (the blender artist forums have this, but most of the posts I've seen are from 2015 lol). </p>

<p>In about a couple days, I modelled a rubber duckie and animated a few different scenes. I had the start and end points be the same so if different events happened I could stack them. I decided to have a couple tulips fly by in random directions, and this proved to be an issue because I chose a really small focal length. This resulted in a skewed axis, and it was difficult to choose positions that didn't make it look like the tulip was a curveball. I guess I could've just had the tulip fly into the distance and then delete it with a sparkle or something (an idea I wish I did now that I'm writing it)</p>

<p>I also learned how to use Davinci Resolve, a video editing program for this project. I really wish I had learned earlier. I know I've used at least one other free video editor before, but it's been years and I was a bit nervous. Turns out it was super intuitive and I picked it up in 10 minutes. I will definitely be using it alongside blender to create longer videos with audio. Blender has post processing as well as audio effects built in, but I don't need to perfect the workflow right now. Sometimes just getting the project done is the best, not getting it done in the absolute minimum amount of time.</p>

<p>For some things I would like to do in the future, I would like to do more animations set to a playlist, and maybe work with rigid bodies and collisions in a space setting. I'm also looking at creating drivers tied to audio tracks to hopefully make it more immersed with the music. Can't wait! üòÉ</p>
