<p>So I've known I wanted a website for about a week now. During that time, I used a three day weekend to relearn HTML and CSS (I have some knowledge of them thanks to the great folks over at Khan Academy (｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡)) and created a simple static website that has a navigation bar, footer, and interconnected pages.</p>

<p>I just now learned about all the different websites that help users create their own websites, and have went from feeling pretty smart to feeling pretty dumb haha. But it's all good! I think that logic can be harmful and essentially apply to a lot of things. That logic being: "why learn to code this, I'm sure if I look hard enough, I can find this exact thing I'm looking for on Stack Overflow or GitHub in a couple hours". What's the defeating counterargument? It's that LEARNING IS FUN!! I enjoyed creating a Website from scratch, and I enjoyed learning the shortcuts in Adobe Dreamweaver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A quick note on Adobe, I went with a friend to visit Adobe's headquarters the other day, and the interior was absolutely beautiful. Each floor and nook and cranny was expertly designed in terms of form and function. The food was also super good :)</p>

<!-- wp:image {"align":"full","style":{"border":{"radius":"0px"}},"className":"is-style-rounded"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull has-custom-border is-style-rounded"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QMwIEtotCaTy7HQhM_e6AMm7ZagCR_Jj3iHt6ve9icX2fZ7E70bYWd4rRTiDvAMDriQ_L9rs1sUOB7ZFgv9iXnJWv215UAHxW569cnEi-LLY6m-h8LY6klAIv5uTnSDq9qgn4WdJHbfspaOQQb1eEH0" alt="" style="border-radius:0px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I mean, just look at this natural light! There was a full panoramic view in the dining area as well</figcaption></figure>

<p>Also, if I want to make this website unique, I have the basics covered. This allows me to do something that can't be found in GitHub eventually. Original ideas still exist! (As an aside, doesn't it feel like there isn't any more inventions that can be made in 2023? Like all the good ideas were already had? I get that feeling sometimes. It's not true like the stuff above but still xD)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm gonna host my personal website here, so Blogger can handle all the pages being interconnected, and other basic functionality, and then I can worry about making it look <strong>beautiful </strong>and <em>unique.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Hopefully by the time you're reading this the page has already been wonderfully styled :) Thanks for reading!</p>
