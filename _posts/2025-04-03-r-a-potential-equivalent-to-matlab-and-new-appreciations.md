<p>As a student at San Jose State University, I took a lot of things for granted. One of those things being software licenses for a lot of great programs. But as I am about to lose those ever so precious student license status, I wanted to branch out to the fee, open source equivalents before they go away.<br></p>

<p>The first program I thought didn’t even have any competitors was MATLAB. I had seen Minitlab as another alternative, but that requires licenses as well. MATLAB can be free, but you’re limited to only 10 hours a month I believe. The important thing that I will lose out on though is toolboxes. I had access to a lot of toolboxes that Mathworks has developed, both for specific use cases (like spacecraft dynamics) and useful addons. They weigh in at around 45 bucks a toolbox, which makes me regret not trying out some random stuff (<strong>though I still have time!</strong>). MathWorks had its own user generated function base as well, but I didn’t take advantage of it.<br></p>

<p>Enter R. Something that exists. It’s free, open source, and distributable. Lots of people work on packages that can be added on to R. And some of them are pretty complex and powerful. R is pretty humble on its own, and comes with some demos to run. Compared to MATLAB, with its 4 windows and autofill and centralized documentation, it doesn’t seem like much. But after running the demos, including demonstrating topography, normal graph outputs, and image alteration, I realized everything under the hood was just as powerful as MATLAB. I then was looking at some of the packages that people have made, and I realized that R and MATLAB are just code, and there’s not really a “limit” in the sense of what you can do with both. MathWorks has a dedicated team of software engineers sure, but nothing quite beats a community that supports an open source project. <br></p>

<p>So, I started using this resource: <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">https://r4ds.hadley.nz/</a> named R for Data Science<br></p>

<p>Following this well written book, data science was very fun to learn. To start, I made the Penguin Flipper length breakdown with the species graph above. And it was easy. A lot easier than working with statistics in MATLAB. MATLAB makes it pretty easy tho, with auto generated code and a GUI, but the so called “grammar of graphics” thought process of tidy R practices is just easier. Less code, and less mental thought can go into breakdowns with R, so I look forward to learning it concurrently with MATLAB and other tools. Thanks!<br></p>
