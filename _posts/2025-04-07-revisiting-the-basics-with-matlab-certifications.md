<p>I am currently in the midst of a job search (reach out if you would like to hire me lol) and I figured I would go back and take some of MATLAB and Mathworks well written courses. A lot of the courses cover basic things - like data types and programming habits that transfer over to other languages, and it also covers basic stuff like its IDE and other interactive systems.<br></p>

<p>I first started with Deep Learning, since it was a toolbox I never really played around in, and thought it would be a good introduction. It turned out it was, and I had a lot of fun using MATLAB’s deep learning tools along with Computer Vision to track a turtle in a video. The process both seemed easier but also more complicated than I would have thought. I didn’t really know what the process of Deep Learning or Machine Learning looked like, so a clear flow chart showing me was enlightening and still kinda confusing. When these models are made, a small chart can’t quite represent the sheer scale at which they operate. But some models can still be simple, because they can be downloaded and run on a laptop, so I guess it can’t be that much more intense than any other program. I will talk more about Deep Learning in MATLAB once I finish the “Machine Learning” Learning Path. Once I did 3 of those courses, I figured I should start at the beginning and see if I gained more from the process.<br></p>

<p>Anyway, I also learned a bunch about basic concepts and quick shortcuts that I just didn’t know about in MATLAB. Because MATLAB puts almost everything into matrices, viewing certain data types through the lens of matrices and transposes can be helpful. There were a bunch of functions I just wasn’t aware of that will come in handy in statistics in the future - like “movmean” which takes the moving average of an element. I also was introduced to the “refactor” button, which takes a body of code and makes it into a function. I was embarrassed after finding out about that one. I really should’ve known about that sooner - it would’ve saved me a bunch of time. But now I know. And now is the second best time for me to have learned, so there we go. I also got tired of some datasets - I don’t want to see electricity usage get plotted for multiple countries ever again (some publicly available datasets were reused in different tutorials).&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>I’m looking forward to building more on the basics - from unit testing (I haven’t utilized this type of code analysis at all) to learning more about machine learning and simscape (though I am knowledgeable about Simulink already) in the future. Until next time, where I have more digital credentials and am a more competent engineer and data analyst! :)<br></p>
