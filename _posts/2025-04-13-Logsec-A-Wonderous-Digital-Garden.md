Logsec, yet another reason to love and be grateful for open source projects. Now, I know, the title is a big dramatic, but I have really appreciates Logsec for a while now, and have been using it in my day to day life. I've had it for about 2 years now, which is kinda crazy. My graph (the visualization of all the pages or markdown files I've written) has expanded to be bigger than I would have ever thought

There's been times where I haven't used Logsec for months, but I've always came back. I used Google Docs for some note-taking, mainly because everything is backed up. But since, I've found a way around that with Syncthing (I'll write a seperate post about that). But yeah, Logsec is great. It's notetaking where you don't need to worry about organzing everything later, but instead organize things as you go with tags and links to other pages. The other page will be linked, and random connections that I wouldn't of been able to visualize before are made.
### Easy Markdown Export to Jekyll
In addition, I've been writing blurbs about everything on my website hosted on Github Pages with Jekyll, which *also* works with straight markdown files. Soooo, I can just write stuff in Logsec, and be able to view everything in a markdown format and export it in the same way. You can actually export in other direct methods, like html, but it's nice to have my notetaking environment be different than what I would want my website to look. (you could also just grab the file in the directory since its stored as a .md, but the indentation makes stuff weird)
Some of the things I've taken notes on or just imported were:
- A DND custom campaign setting's items and classes for reference
- I tried to think of and write down everyone I've ever met, and how they relate to me and each other. I wanted it to be like a Rolodex but 100 times as complex lol. One of the actually beneficial use cases for this is networking, as you can give people tags like whether or not you played a sport with them or where you met
- journals, Logsec's main feed sort of. I use these in conjunction with templates quite a bit, with a section devoted to what I'm feeling that day, along with a To Do list, that can be indexed into in future days -- which makes me more accountable
I look forward to continue using Logsec in my daily life, and hopefully when I land a job and I can use it to take more intensive, serious notes on workflows and SOPs and things to remember. In addition, I can't wait to see what my graph looks like in 5 years! That will be crazy haha. Hopefully the connections to previous articles will make it interesting as well.
