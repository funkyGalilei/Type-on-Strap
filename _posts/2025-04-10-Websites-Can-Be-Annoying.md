# im editing this from my phone!
### and hopefully it works

I've had a lot of issues getting this up and running unfortunately. Now, the whole point of Jekyll and other static website making software is that its easy. And it is easy. When you have markdown files all ready to go. I didn't. Instead i had a wordpress xml file, which was able to be imported using the jekyll and bundle commands, but everything isn't quite right.

in addition, some of the formatting is kept, and at this point i might just keep the dates on everything, but repaste in the text of the posts which i have in a google doc. but anyway, we'll see how it goes and the best part is theres no ads in this site, so all the pain is worth it haha
