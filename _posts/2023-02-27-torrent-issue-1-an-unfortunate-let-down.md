<p>I picked this issue up while grabbing Saga, and this one was an unfortunate let down. Now, I wanted to only review comics that I really liked, but there wouldn’t be a baseline for my reviews if I just gave out five outta fives, so here’s my first negative review.</p>

<p>To summarize my reaction, I went in expecting Invincible, and got a dud. Now, the story starts off with basic superhero tropes and cliches, and then hits the reader with some gnarly torture scenes and reality. I think the writers were expecting the reader to be lured into a false sense of security with the normal hero-quipping, but I didn’t even come close to falling for it (maybe just because I was coming off of a Saga trip, which is decidedly more intense). I think this arc had more to do with length than the actual writing. Invincible pulls this off incredibly well, with the first full dose of insanely gory reality smashing the viewer after a few episodes. This occurred in the comics even earlier, and Robert Kirkman remarked that he would’ve pushed this back later in the comics if he could. Pulling a move like this off in a short first issue just couldn’t work. I also understand that pulling off a longer first issue print is financially risky and difficult, but I think this series really would’ve benefitted.</p>

<p>To add on to this, the first issue wasn’t that long. It was the size of a normal issue. Which is fine, but it’s really difficult to hook readers on a short first issue where there’s a twist. Brian K. Vaughn had his first issue of Saga be beefier on the first issue (and the newest issue when the series relaunched), and it works great. After reading Torrent, I wasn’t hooked because things felt too packed together. It wasn’t impactful and I wasn’t wanting more.</p>

<p>Now let’s get into why it wasn’t impactful. Have I just watched too much of The Boys and brutal massacres don’t affect me anymore? Maybe lol. But right after the main character’s husband gets murdered, she throws out a one-liner. I can’t even remember it and don’t want to bother looking it up. Even if the one-liner was actually good, who is really gonna say something badass after their spouse was murdered and their kid was stolen? Is that really where anyone’s mind could go? And I get it if you’re thinking “Its a comic book, let the characters be cool!”, but it seems like the point of that action in the plot was to elevate it above quipping superheroes, and thrust it into a “The Boys”-like world. The quip brings it right back.</p>

<p>One small thing I’ll say about the art, it's great! Very expressive! Lots of great color contrast and the poses were very well put together. I don’t think I liked the character design of the main character though. She looks badass, but nothing about her design signals “mom”. I thought she was a teenager when I initially saw the cover, and didn’t get it until the story explicitly told me. Now, I get that moms as a group don’t have one look, and that they can look like almost anyone, but I would’ve liked maybe a more tired look lol. I mean, if I was fighting supervillains during the day and then had to raise a kid? There would be bags under my eyes 24/7. I actually just have bags under my eyes right now 24/7 xD (I get enough sleep, it's just a thing I guess lol). I dunno though, just my two cents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a final send off, I get how hard it is to write a story. I think reading a story as a human is a lot like judging visible art, or figure drawings. You don’t need to be an expert per say, you can just intuitively notice when things are off. And you notice things being off because we’re always around stories. Stories that we’re in, stories that we read and watch, and just our own human thoughts. I think it's a lot harder to write a good story than to make a good wine in that way (because I really would have no idea what differentiates a good wine and a bad wine, it takes built up taste and thought). I think I’ll try to write a story eventually, and it probably won’t be good, so no shade to the authors. I still enjoyed reading. It might get better too, this is just the first issue. And I hope you enjoyed reading this review! Have a nice day :)</p>
