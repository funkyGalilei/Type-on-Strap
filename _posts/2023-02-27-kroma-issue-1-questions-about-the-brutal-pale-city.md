<p>The main characters live in the supposed last bastion of humankind - a city where there is no color. There exist large color sensing lizards (sounds silly, but they’re designed well and are imposing) that roam the Earth and kill any colorful lifeform or creature that emits a sound. These flesh devouring monsters were supposedly created by The King of Colors, a being that spited mankind for creating new colors. The society of this last Pale City is distinct, and any color inside the city is forbidden, including on food, people, and buildings. Color does not exist in the inhabitants' pupils or skin, as the practice of eugenics was previously used to smother any remaining traces of past humankind. We follow Zed, a loyal member and leader of the Makkas, enforcers of the current main leader, The Makavi, of Pale City.  The story opens on a ceremony where the colorless citizens hunt a supposed killer monster created by The King of Color. In the “hatching” and chase of the external skull bearing monster, Zed peers into the monster’s eyes and experiences a vision of his mother, warning him that “they” are lying. This curiosity towards this monster haunts Zed, and he confronts it in a lone tower where it is confined. Doing so, Zed is shocked to find out that the “Second Plague” is a young girl his age, who believes that she is the wicked creature the leader and townsfolk think she is. As Zed becomes more comfortable with her, he begins to empathize. At the comics closing, Zed and the girl are sitting at the top of the tower enjoying a view of the surrounding colors when a spear impales Zed’s chest suddenly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first comic review I’m writing, and I couldn’t quite pick a place to begin reviewing comics. I could talk about the art, the panel layouts, the color, the dialogue, character design, worldbuilding, themes, and so many other things. When I started jotting down an outline, I realized that Kroma demonstrates how amazing a comic can be. Because these separate elements combine and form new things, and discussing them can’t be as regimented as I want them to be. The great character design in Kroma directly informs the story, becomes a part of the worldbuilding, and pushes the story’s themes. Basically, I’m saying all&nbsp; of this to apologize if I come off rambly, I might jump from sequence to sequence.</p>

<p>To pick an element to start with, I’ll choose a theme Kroma displays effortlessly: mob mentality and acting on prejudices, perhaps even indoctrination. In the intro panel to “The Second Plague”, we see a massive claw strung around a small hand breaking through an egg shell. Now, from that panel, if the reader were to stop and really ponder that situation, many questions could be had about the origin of this monster. As its later revealed, the monster is not a monster at all but rather a brain-washed child. Now, I may just be dumb, but reading that first reveal panel, I took the Makavi’s words at face value. I was reading somewhat quickly as the pace of the chase scene seemed quicker, and missed many details on the first read. Rereading the comic a second time, I appreciated the <strong>character design</strong> much much more. The small girl is not merely just “wearing” the skull that is on her head, but it is strapped to her, with bands to conceal her face. The talons on her feet are just boots, and the claws are just an attachment. All blacked out shadows in the art are used to great effect, and to my shock on the second read, a set of shouting teeth can be seen in the chase sequence. The jagged, sharp teeth of the skull is offset by the screaming maw of the young girl underneath. The realization is shocking to say the least! So smart, I wonder how many people noticed that. Probably a lot, again, I might just be dumb. Anyway, I really appreciate subtle story hints such as this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To transition to another story element, the <strong>dialogue </strong>and <strong>world building</strong> was great. The story only focuses on a few characters, which allows the readers to begin to understand them quicker, and begin many more initial questions about them and the world as well. One of my favorite comic specific techniques in this issue was the all black page with panels only consisting of text bubbles, implying that the characters are in the dark. It was a great storytelling device that also made the scene more intimate between the two characters, and was enabled by the comics' longer format. I feel that if that were a page and a half in a normal comic issue, it might’ve felt like a waste of space. Even so, I appreciated Radiant Black going into a writer's deep dive for a whole issue, so maybe not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story reads as a future literary classic, with few characters and serious tones as mentioned before, and because of this I began to think about the future of the characters and make guesses, as one does. I guessed that Zed would continue seeing the captive girl, and then he would break her out somehow. I was dead (hee-hee get it?) wrong on that one. I found it interesting that instead of going the normal “damsel in distress” route, this story chose to have the main leading character the girl that is being ostracized by Pale City. She is the cover for the future issues as well, so it’s basically confirmed. I hope the humanity Zed gave her gives her some fragment of self worth. I think this was a great choice, and I’m really all out of predictions. I can’t wait to see where this story goes and I’m super excited to read the next issue in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and remember, <strong>fold your spines a little bit before trapping your comics away in a plastic slab!</strong> I don’t really know what that was, I was trying a catchphrase signoff, but it looks like I’ll have to work on it a little longer lol&nbsp;</p>
