<p class="has-medium-font-size">Spoiler Alert! Every review will be going over spoilers, just an FYI. It’s kinda hard to talk about Saga without them, so there’s the warning in advance.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I really liked this issue! I had to venture out into the wet, raining interior of San Jose and utilize the rickety public buses (jk, it's actually pretty nice except for the guy who tossed an old circuit board at my foot - it was weird and surreal but it wasn’t hard and I just got off at the next stop anyway xD) to get to Space Cat, my local comic book shop. Space Cat is such a good name for a comic book store, isn’t it? The aesthetic of their website is pretty neat, despite it probably being designed in the 2000s. You can check it out here :) <a href="http://superspacecat.com/index1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://superspacecat.com/index1.htm</a> Woah! I just noticed there’s an /index at the end of their landing page! And thanks to learning how to define a site in Dreamweaver, I know what it is!! It feels good to recognize the structure of something. Too bad my knowledge only applies to super stripped down websites from the ancient internet. I was actually thinking about redesigning it for them, we’ll see if I follow through on that. Anyway, this is just an aside, I’m supposed to be reviewing Saga here! On to it:</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I really enjoyed this chapter. I was satisfied. And I mean that word specifically. Other chapters have left me feeling at a loss or pissed off (a lot of being pissed off), but this one had no cliffhangers and set the stage for future chapters quite a bit. It also fleshed out a bit of the past, showing a conversation between Petrichor and Alana, over the rotting, gross, gnarly corpse of a former Marco. Very on brand lol. Anyway, Petrichor is rightfully pissed and swears a blood vengeance against the people that offed Marco, and Alana laughs! Without context, this might seem super insensitive and crazy, but one of the main themes of Saga is not letting previous violence define you. Or at least I think it is. Anyway, Alana laughs and rightfully states that if somehow Marco could weigh in on their situation, he would want her to take care of Squire and Hazel, not risk all of their lives trying to kill some stranger. Which brought me so much feel-good energy. Just absolute “thank you for listening, I can’t believe stuff is going/went in the right direction”. That doesn’t happen much in Saga, so I’ll take those moments where I can get them.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">One small complaint is that the bat family’s brutal massacre at the end was unfortunately pretty expected, and I felt nothing like a weathered war veteran. I guess that's just what happens when you repeatedly get shocked for 60+ chapters, sooner or later you're gonna know when there’s no way characters are leaving those panels breathing.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The interaction Squire had with Alana and the r-slur seemed an interesting one. As a quick summary, Alana was reading one of the best works of fiction in a fictional graphic novel to her kids, and decided to read the r-slur out loud. Hazel then is offended and points out that her mom should have not said that in front of Squire, as he has been called that word before (he is mute due to insane amounts of trauma). First off, I thought it was a bit weird that Saga itself almost is taking Alana’s side of the argument, by being a piece of media featuring a slur, not really used in modern discourse. Now, Saga is obviously not going to shy away from controversial issues, as that’s one of the things that makes it so great. This situation feels a little different however, as it's almost a part of the argument it’s trying to make. Because of this, I was immediately assuming it was a self insert from BKV? But Hazel is written by him too, and nuance and complexity is involved, so it's not that simple. Anyway, I thought back to my junior year of high school where my white English teacher said the n-word. It was interesting? He gave an argument before he said it, but it was more of just that: an argument, not a discussion. If it was more of a discussion I probably would have felt better. Anyway, I always thought: <em>“What’s the real benefit to saying a slur out loud compared to reading it?” </em>I get how reading historical fiction could benefit from slurs, as it would be weird and inaccurate if slave owners didn’t use dehumanizing language they used during the time period. It just doesn’t seem worth it to me. Anyway, the situation in Saga is definitively different, as the inclusion of the r-slur was just to imply “this thing is stupid and bad”, and not in the context of being spoken by an ableist person. It even goes on to state that Squire <em>already</em> read the book, and thought it was meh. It might have been his mom audibly saying the word that was hurtful? I don’t know, but this controversial dive moved me more than any other controversy I can think of (Abortion Town included lol).</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a final note, I love Squire so much lol. I know he’s gonna get himself into some trouble soon, with trying to revive one of his dead dads and all, but I just want him to have an amazing normal, turbulent free childhood lol. I hope you enjoyed reading my review! I enjoyed reading this issue, so I’ll be standing on the benchless bus platforms for as long as it takes to grab chapter 63 next month, rain or shine :)&nbsp;</p>
