<p>Well, I’ll give this one 2 stars because I have a lot of mixed feelings about this one. </p>

<p>The story focuses on Ethan and Ella, and Ella’s son Michael. They are Jewish, and after a supernatural event where anomalies appear in multiple locations around the world, antisemitism is rising. The plot (spoilers), basically follows them and the community that develops as they survive and collaborate with other Jews in a city called the Pale. Stuff gets worse and worse, with the outside world continuing to keep Jewish people occupied, and many Jews decide to enter into the anomalies of their own accord<br></p>

<p>I did love and really appreciate some things about this book for sure. The themes about parenting, the covid pandemic, and military occupation were really captivating. I found the fathers in the book really interesting as well. What parents will do for their children is something that I understand as a human, but haven’t fully appreciated what that really means. Existing by myself and honoring relationships with people my age and my parents is one thing, but existing with someone wholly dependent upon you is almost otherworldly. <br>To the parts I didn’t like so much:</p>

<li>When reading other reviews someone mentioned the Palestinian people, and the lack of their existence in the book. That’s definitely another weird spot for me. If they were supposedly in the anomaly that swallowed Israel, does that mean that they are in the subway with everyone else, or are they now gone? Not addressing or explaining what happens to non-Jews is weird in my opinion. I feel that if the book had non-Jewish people existing in the underground I would have a much different opinion on it.</li>

<li>I thought the story was going to go into a “Monsters are Due on Maple Street” direction, a story from the Twilight Zone where weird stuff happens and people become paranoid, but there seemed to be an actual link in the story between Jewish people and the anomalies? The ending clearly alludes to a possible second coming, but even before that, Jewish people in the story react differently around the anomaly. Which seems to take away from the critique of antisemitism almost. </li>

<p>If a supernatural event happened, people would surely use Jewish people as a scapegoat even if it was completely unrelated, and the book does touch on this. A lonely man on an island connects a blight of trees to Jews, which is obviously ridiculous, but then actual differences in interacting with the anomaly kinda throws this off. They can’t speak when they’re near it, which doesn’t make any sense. If I were to suspend my disbelief, I would say that then this makes Judaism the closest to being “real” in this world, which also rings a little weird to me?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, if this was done with another group, I don’t know how the world would react to a certain ethnic background being concretely linked to a supernatural event. The sci-fi elements of the story then don’t seem necessary when in real life people attribute all sorts of things incorrectly to Jewish people</p>

<p><br>The ending was open ended, and reading that Ella and Ethan couldn’t go with Michael was sad. I understood that was the direction the story was heading (there was foreshadowing with Ella’s father), but it fell kinda flat for me. With this, I’ll describe the pacing. The pacing was pretty steady and therefore not interesting, with time jumps happening every chapter, and again, stuff just getting worse and worse slowly, with no real development on the sci-fi. I get that that might be the point, existing and providing for the next generation, but I feel like the whole arc in the underground could’ve been cut to 3 paragraphs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a bleak book that I did appreciate some parts of, but couldn’t really take anything from the main thrust of it. <br></p>
