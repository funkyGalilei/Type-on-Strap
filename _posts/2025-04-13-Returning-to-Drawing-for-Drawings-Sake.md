Often I feel like I'm chasing a workflow that I'll never able to fully optimize. I shave time off of one thing, and create a node group in blender that I'll be able to reuse in another project. But the time to create sometimes feels like its just *too long*. But that's okay honestly. This thought process of "how do I make this process shorter" is sometimes the wrong question.

I haven't been drawing nearly as much as I used to. I don't doodle or do brainstorming sessions with visual drawing anymore. And I think I'm not doing it because with drawing, you're the one making every stroke. There's no copy pattern possibility, every additional texture or value is manual. And that's cool! Not a setback! And that's a reminder that I need to liberate myself and getting back to just drawing for drawings sake, and feeling satisfied after working on one piece for an hour.

In addition, I've had the habit of switching between different creative projects and not being able to fully execute. Now, this is nothing that isn't familiar to other creatives. People get burnt out, or in my case, find something else that I'm maybe even more excited about. The solution to this, that I've found is:

# join everything together!
that way, the stuff I'm maybe more excited about in the moment can lift up the stuff I'm not as excited about. The other things can inform the main point of the art I'm creating. Something else that I just need to do is to constantly practice and to create a *routine*. I definitely need to get better at that. But, once those positive routines are made, they're easier to keep than they were at the beginning, which is a really good thing. (also uninstalling TikTok or other short form content dopamine blasts has been helpful haha)
Here's a random piece I made with a reference of an old growth forest, during which I attempted to freehand a figure - which didn't go well. *Meaning*, I'm gonna need to go back to figure drawing practice haha. I look forward to it! :)
